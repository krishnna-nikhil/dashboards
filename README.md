###  Data Analytics Dashboards Portfolio

This repository contains business dashboards created using **Python (ETL), Microsoft SQL Server**, and **Power BI**. All dashboards follow color theory and clean visual design principles to make data intuitive for stakeholders.

####  Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**: Built ETL scripts to correct inconsistencies and prepare raw sales, purchase, and expense data.
2. **Database Integration (SQL Server)**: Loaded clean data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio; applied necessary transformations via queries.
3. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**: Imported SQL tables, created DAX measures and references, and built interactive, insight-rich dashboards.
