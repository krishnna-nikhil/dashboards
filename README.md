##  Project Architecture

### 1. Data Engineering (Python)

* **Production-ready ETL pipelines** built using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **custom business logic** for data standardization, cleansing, and enrichment.
* Includes **regex parsing**, **outlier detection**, **feature engineering**, and **pre-aggregation** to optimize downstream reporting.
* Modular, reusable `.py` files structured for **scalability and maintainability**.

| Python Script         | Focus Area                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `af.ai - purchase.py` | Vendor performance and spend optimization                |
| `af.ai - expense.py`  | Cost control and anomaly detection in expenses           |
| `af.ai - sales.py`    | Revenue drivers, sales segmentation, and growth tracking |
| `bb 50-50_stores.py`  | Multi-location product-level sales performance           |

### 3. Business Intelligence Dashboards (Power BI)

* **Executive-ready dashboards** crafted with **DAX**, **Power BI relationships**, and **custom measures** for dynamic, multi-level reporting.
* **Real-time insights** through advanced interactive elements like drilldowns, slicers, and KPI trend visualizations.
* **Human-centered design principles** applied to every report:

  * Clean, minimalistic layouts
  * Strategic use of color theory for faster cognitive recognition
  * Intuitive navigation for non-technical users
